# Troubleshooting
* I did not receive an SMS verification code?  
  The first time you log in with the desktop app, since it is a new device, the verification code will be sent via email, you can find it [this way](https://github.com/Annihil/revolut-emergency/wiki/How-to-login-with-email)
* I cannot open the app on macOS (unidentified developer)  
  Instead of double clicking on the R Emergency.app, right click â†’ Open  
  If that is still not enough, you will have to go to System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Click Open anyway
